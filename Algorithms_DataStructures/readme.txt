Algorithms and Datastructures

This is an application prototype demonstrating how given algorithms work.

Currently implemented algorithms using the datatype array are two
sorting algorithms BubbleSort and QuickSort, and LinearSearch as
searching algorithm.

Supported datatypes are Integer, Double and String (-Lists).
Input-lists are generated with random data.

Results (and algorithm flow) are printed to the default console.

Variation is achieved by using the preprocessor Antenna
