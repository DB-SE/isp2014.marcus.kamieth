Algorithms and Datastructures
=============================

This is an application prototype demonstrating how given algorithms work.

Currently implemented algorithms using the datatype array are two
sorting algorithms BubbleSort and QuickSort, and LinearSearch as
searching algorithm.

Results (and detailed algorithm flow) are printed to the default console.

In this application FeatureHouse is used to build the program from single
features. Some possible configurations are put in the configs/ folder.
